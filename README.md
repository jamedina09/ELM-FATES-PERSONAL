# Personal Elm-Fates Container

This repository contains the Dockerfile and other information that I used to create my personal Elm-Fates container.

## Overview

I make heavy use of Podman for container management. This Docker was inspired by the work in two repos:

- [Repo 1](https://github.com/serbinsh/elm_containers)
- [Repo 2](https://github.com/NGEET/fates-tutorial)
