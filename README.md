# Personal Elm-Fates Container

This repository contains the images that I used to create my personal Elm-Fates container.

## Overview

I make heavy use of Podman for container management. The Dockerfile in this repository was inspired by the work of:

- [Shawn P. Serbin](https://github.com/serbinsh/elm_containers)
- [NGEETROPICS - Gregory Lemieux - Jessy Needham](https://github.com/NGEET/fates-tutorial)

Feel free to explore and adapt the contents for your own use!
